                                I've always enjoyed spending my free time at the computer. When I was 
                                younger, I was only using the computer to play games but now I use it 
                                for something more. I found myself in writing simple programmes in 
                                different coding languages: C++, C, Java, Python and html. Most programmes
                                I'm writing are in python because it's an easy and pleasant language. 
                                I'll put some codes and screenshots in this repository:<br><br>

                                I also found myself in programming video games in Unreal Engine. It took
                                some time to learn the basics but I think that it was worth it. Of course,
                                the further I went the more time it took to learn this new things, understand
                                how it works and why does has to be done in one way and not the other, for example:
                                Behaviour Trees. After 2 years I started learning how does the 'Behaviour Tree' 
                                works and it took me something about 2-3 months to learn it's basics. But I 'had' 
                                to learn 'Behaviour Tree' because it really helped me while I was trying to create 
                                an AI controlled character.<br>

                                <h3>Modeling</h3>
                                To create a game you need code and assets. I learned how to write a code so what's left 
                                was assets. Of course I could buy assets but they are expensive, sometimes too expensive.
                                So I decided that I have to learn how to create them(the small ones). To do that I downloaded
                                'blender' and started playing with it. It took some time but I managed to learn how to use it.
                                I started by creating simple shapes and after some time I began to try to create more complex 
                                models like 'Scottish Claymore' with a fuller.

                                    When my professor introduced Schrödinger's Cat in class, it sparked a profound curiosity within me. The idea
                                    that a cat could exist in a state of both being alive and dead simultaneously until observed challenged
                                    my understanding of reality and left me with an insatiable desire to delve deeper into the mysteries of
                                    quantum physics.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Quantum physics is a captivating field that delves into the fundamental nature of reality at the smallest
                                    scales. It challenges our conventional understanding of the universe and introduces mind-bending concepts
                                    that defy intuition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Exploring quantum physics opens the door to a realm of fascinating phenomena, from entanglement and
                                    wave-particle duality to the uncertainty principle. It's a field that continues to push the boundaries of
                                    our understanding and has profound implications for technology, philosophy, and our perception of reality.

                                <p>
                                    As I delve deeper into the mysteries of quantum physics, I'm continually amazed by the richness and
                                    complexity of the quantum world. It's a journey of discovery that challenges me to question my assumptions
                                    and expand my perspective, and I'm excited to see where it leads.
