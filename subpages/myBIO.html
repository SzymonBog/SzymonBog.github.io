            I don't expect anyone to know/remember me. Even if you think that you 
            know/remember me you probably don't know the <b><u>real</u></b> me. I've 
            changed a lot since 2017 and I didn't want to show it. I think that I was
            afraid to be rejected. But let's start from the begining.
