            I don't expect anyone to know/remember me. Even if you think that you 
            know/remember me you probably don't know the <b style="color:crimson"><u>real</u></b> me. I've 
            changed a lot since 2017 and I didn't want to show it. I think that I was
            afraid to be rejected. But let's start from the begining.

            <br><br><h2 id="childhood" style="color:white">Childhood</h2>
            To be honest I can barely remember my childhood, maybe because nothing special 
            happened at that time or maybe because my bad memories replaced the good ones 
            or because my childhood ended when I was 14 years old. 
            The only things I remember from those times are certain events with friends, 
            including one school trip in 6-th grade. That's it. When I think about this, 
            it's kinda sad.
            
            <br><br><h2 id="terminal illness" style="color:white">Terminal illness</h2>
            <!--The worst part of my life.--><!--I == broken toy-->
            At the end of January 2017 I started seeing double. Soon I went to the hospital 
            where I underwent a brain tomography and then a brain MRI. It turned out that 
            I had a brain tumor. I was transported to another hospital where my fight for 
            life began. On February 21, 2017, my skull was opened and my old/normal life 
            ended. The surgery was successful and the tumor was removed. I was on painkillers 
            for a week after the surgery and I don't remember anything from that week, maybe 
            that's for the better. After that I went through 4 cycles of chemotherapy, 3 days 
            each. After the 2nd or 3rd cycle of chemotherapy, I probably became depressed, 
            I felt like I was a burden to my family, I even considered committing suicide. 
            Suicidal thoughts didn't last very long, but the fact that they appeared when I 
            was 14 shows how much this event destroyed my psyche. But my psyche was negatively <!--\/-->
            affected not only by the experience but also by what I saw there. In the hospital 
            where I was treated, I saw dozens, if not hundreds of children, with scars on 
            their heads from surgery, without hair from chemotherapy, aged from about 6 to 16 
            years. Seeing this, I began to wonder what kind of all-powerful, all-knowing and 
            all-good god could allow this, and I came to the conclusion that such a god does 
            not exist. If there is a god, I am sure that he is not all-good, all-powerful or 
            all-knowing, because theoretically if he was, he would not allow something like 
            this to happen to children who have done nothing wrong. <!--/\-->After the last chemo, the 
            only thing left was radiotherapy(the best part of my treatment). Radiotherapy 
            lasted for 5 weeks, after which the treatment ended. Only one of my friends kept 
            in touch with me and supported me, and the rest of my friends left me and forgot 
            about me.<!---->I felt like a toy you don't try to fix when it breaks, you just throw it 
            away and forget about it.<!--toy--> All of this made me feel useless/expendable, which caused me to have 
            trust issues and withdraw from society. I lost a lot of friends because of all 
            this. But, to be honest, I'm kinda happy that this happened to me, because I've 
            learned a lot about my 'friends' and about myself. I learned that only in the 
            face of death can you find out how much you mean to your friends and who your 
            true friend is.

            <br><br><h2 id="after terminal illness" style="color:white">My life after terminal illness</h2>
            After finishing the treatment, I didn't feel like myself and it was difficult for 
            me to adapt to life in society. I had problems with any contact with friends. I 
            became even more withdrawn and afraid. I stopped trusting people. When I met someone, I didn't 
            show my true self for fear of rejection. Almost everyone who came into contact with 
            me didn't get to know the real me, only the person I wanted them to know. This went on for 
            about 4 years till I went to college where I met my friends. I started going to a 
            psychologist to get rid of my mental problems.

            <br><br><h2 id="now"  style="color:white">Now</h2>
            After navigating through the challenges of terminal illness, my journey has evolved, 
            and I find myself in a new chapter. The experiences of the past have shaped me, 
            and I'm grateful for the opportunities that continue to come my way.
