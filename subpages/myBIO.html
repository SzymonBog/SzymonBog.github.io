            I don't expect anyone to know/remember me. Even if you think that you 
            know/remember me you probably don't know the <b style="color:crimson"><u>real</u></b> me. I've 
            changed a lot since 2017 and I didn't want to show it. I think that I was
            afraid to be rejected. But let's start from the begining.

            <br><br><h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>
            To be honest I can barely remember my childhood, maybe because nothing special 
            happened at that time or maybe because my bad memories replaced the good ones 
            or because my childhood ended when I was 14 years old. 
            The only things I remember from those times are certain events with friends, 
            including one school trip in 6-th grade. That's it. When I think about this, 
            it's kinda sad.
            
            <br><br><h2 id="terminal illness">Terminal illness</h2>
            <!--The worst part of my life.-->
            At the end of January 2017 I started seeing double. Soon I went to the hospital 
            where I underwent a brain tomography and then a brain MRI. It turned out that 
            I had a brain tumor. I was transported to another hospital where my fight for 
            life began. On February 21, 2017, my skull was opened and my old/normal life 
            ended. The surgery was successful and the tumor was removed. I was on painkillers 
            for a week after the surgery and I don't remember anything from that week, maybe 
            that's for the better. After that I went through 4 cycles of chemotherapy, 3 days 
            each. After the 2nd or 3rd cycle of chemotherapy, I probably became depressed, 
            I felt like I was a burden to my family, I even considered committing suicide. 
            Suicidal thoughts didn't last very long, but the fact that they appeared when I 
            was 14 shows how much this event destroyed my psyche. But my psyche was negatively <!--\/-->
            affected not only by the experience but also by what I saw there. In the hospital 
            where I was treated, I saw dozens, if not hundreds of children, with scars on 
            their heads from surgery, without hair from chemotherapy, aged from about 6 to 16 
            years. Seeing this, I began to wonder what kind of all-powerful, all-knowing and 
            all-good god could allow this, and I came to the conclusion that such a god does 
            not exist. If there is a god, I am sure that he is not all-good, all-powerful or 
            all-knowing, because theoretically if he was, he would not allow something like 
            this to happen to children who have done nothing wrong. <!--/\-->After the last chemo, the 
            only thing left was radiotherapy(the best part of my treatment). Radiotherapy 
            lasted for 5 weeks, after which the treatment ended. Only one of my friends kept 
            in touch with me and supported me, and the rest of my friends left me and forgot 
            about me. All of this made me feel useless/expendable, which caused me to have 
            trust issues and withdraw from society. I lost a lot of friends because of all 
            this. But, to be honest, I'm kinda happy that this happened to me, because I've 
            learned a lot about my 'friends' and about myself. I learned that only in the 
            face of death can you find out how much you mean to your friends and who your 
            true friend is.

            <br><br><h2 id="after terminal illness">My life after terminal illness</h2>
            After finishing the treatment, I didn't feel like myself and it was difficult for 
            me to adapt to life in society.
